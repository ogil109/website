A collection of some of my curated notes on a range of topics related to being a better engineer, father, and person.

## On life

I am both questioning and optimistic: the former drives me to explore the world around me, the latter allows me to make sense of what I learn, helping me persevere in the face of my (almost?) never-ending ignorance.

## On the job

I seek to empower the next generation of value-driven, disruptive companies by providing strategic, robust solutions that help them scale and make an impact in the world to ensure a better tomorrow (for all of us).
