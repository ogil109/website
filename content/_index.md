# What is this?

A collection of some of my curated notes on a range of topics related to being a better engineer, father, and person.

## Who am I?

I am both questioning and optimistic: the former drives me to explore the world around me, the latter allows me to make sense of what I learn, helping me persevere in the face of my (almost?) never-ending ignorance.

## What I like?

I love building for the people and for what lies ahead, so you'll usually find me cranking my head to implement robust solutions that have a real, long-lasting impact as part of disruptive, value-driven teams.
