A collection of some of my curated notes on a range of topics related to being a better engineer and person.
## On the job
I seek to empower the next generation of ethical companies by providing strategic, robust solutions that help them scale and make an impact in the world to ensure a better tomorrow for humanity.
## On life
I am both questioning and optimistic: the former drives me to explore the world around me, grounding me in reality; the latter pushes me to transform the infinite complexity of everything into meaning, helping me persevere in the face of my (almost?) never-ending ignorance.
